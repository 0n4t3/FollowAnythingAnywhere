Nostr, short for “Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays”, is a decentralized social media protocol built to house short text posts. Accounts are created via public/private keys on a device, then the content posted to the account is mirrored on the relays of the account holder’s choosing. [Learn More](https://nostr.com/)
