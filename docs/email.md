We all know what email is, no need for an introduction.

As a disclaimer, there's a lot less that can be listed here, it's mostly just enabling email notifications with a particular service.

Pro Tip: If you want to follow content via email consider setting up filters to keep your inbox organized, and consider using an aliasing service or second email to avoid spam.
